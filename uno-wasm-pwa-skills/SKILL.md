# Uno Platform WebAssembly and PWA

Patterns for building, debugging, optimizing, and deploying Uno Platform apps as WebAssembly applications and Progressive Web Apps.

## Prerequisites

```bash
dotnet workload install wasm-tools
```

Verify: `dotnet workload list` should show `wasm-tools` installed.

## Project Setup

The `net9.0-browserwasm` TFM is included by default in Uno Platform Single Project:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>
    net9.0-android;net9.0-ios;net9.0-browserwasm;net9.0-desktop;net9.0
</TargetFrameworks>
```

### Enable PWA

Add via template or manually:

```bash
dotnet new unoapp -pwa
```

Or add manually:
```xml
<UnoFeatures>
    <!-- other features -->
</UnoFeatures>
```

PWA manifest file (`manifest.webmanifest`) must have `Content` build action. Place in the WebAssembly platform folder or project root.

## Bootstrapper (Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap 9.x)

Version 9.x targets .NET 9 and uses `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WebAssembly`. Key changes from 8.x:

- SDK changed from `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` to `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WebAssembly`
- `Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap.DevServer` package is no longer needed
- Compression handled by .NET SDK (not bootstrapper properties)
- IDBFS not enabled by default; must be explicitly restored

### Bootstrapper Version Mapping

| Bootstrapper | .NET Runtime |
|-------------|-------------|
| 9.x | .NET 9 |
| 10.x | .NET 10 |
| 8.x | .NET 8 |

## Debugging

### Visual Studio 2022

Ensure `launchSettings.json` contains the inspect URI in every profile:

```json
"inspectUri": "{wsProtocol}://{url.hostname}:{url.port}/_framework/debug/ws-proxy?browser={browserInspectUri}"
```

### Browser DevTools

- Use browser F12 console for `Console.WriteLine` output
- Source maps available in debug builds
- Set breakpoints in browser Sources tab under `file://` paths

### Common Wasm Debug Issues

- **Blank screen**: Check browser console for .NET runtime errors
- **Missing assets**: Verify `Content` build action on static files
- **CORS errors**: Configure proper headers on hosting server

## Hosting and Deployment

### Azure Static Web Apps

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Publish
  run: dotnet publish -c Release -f net9.0-browserwasm
- name: Deploy
  uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
  with:
    app_location: "bin/Release/net9.0-browserwasm/publish/wwwroot"
```

### Nginx

Required MIME types for Wasm:
```nginx
types {
    application/wasm wasm;
    application/octet-stream clr;
    application/json json;
    application/javascript js;
}

# Enable compression
gzip on;
gzip_types application/wasm application/javascript application/json;

# Cache immutable assets
location /_framework/ {
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
}
```

### Local Testing

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-serve
dotnet publish -c Debug -f net9.0-browserwasm
dotnet serve -d bin/Debug/net9.0-browserwasm/publish/wwwroot -p 8000
```

## Performance Optimization

### AOT Compilation

Ahead-of-Time compilation improves runtime performance at the cost of larger payloads and longer builds.

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net9.0-browserwasm'">
    <RunAOTCompilation>true</RunAOTCompilation>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Payload Size Reduction

- **Enable trimming** (default in Release): removes unused code
- **Use Brotli compression** on the web server
- **Lazy-load assemblies** for large features not needed at startup
- **Minimize embedded resources**: large images and assets inflate the initial download

### Startup Optimization

- Keep initial visual tree minimal (use `x:Load` for deferred content)
- Defer non-critical service registration
- Use splash screen during .NET runtime initialization

## Threading

WebAssembly threading is **not supported** in Uno Platform on .NET 9. Microsoft's runtime changes prevent managed code from running on the main JavaScript thread. Support may return in future .NET 10 previews.

**Workarounds**:
- Use `Task.Run` for CPU-bound work (runs on thread pool when available)
- Keep UI thread responsive with async/await
- Avoid synchronous blocking calls

## PWA Features

### Service Worker

Configured automatically when PWA is enabled. Handles offline caching of app shell and assets.

### Manifest

```json
{
  "name": "My Uno App",
  "short_name": "UnoApp",
  "start_url": "./",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#6200EE",
  "icons": [
    { "src": "icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" },
    { "src": "icon-512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png" }
  ]
}
```

### Install Prompt

PWA install is handled by the browser. Ensure manifest and service worker are correctly configured for the browser to show the install prompt.

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting `dotnet workload install wasm-tools` before building
- Using `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` instead of `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WebAssembly` with bootstrapper 9.x
- Not setting proper MIME types on hosting server (especially `application/wasm`)
- Expecting threading to work (not supported on .NET 9 Wasm)
- Not adding `inspectUri` to `launchSettings.json` for debugging
- Using deprecated bootstrapper properties from 8.x (see migration list in docs)
